;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'hardhat)
;;
;;     (global-hardhat-mode 1)
;;
;;     ;; now you are protected from editing:
;;     ;;
;;     ;;     .git/index
;;     ;;     ~/.emacs.d/elpa/hardhat-0.1.0/hardhat.el
;;     ;;     ~/.emacs~
;;     ;;
;;     ;; and many others
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; A recent unwholesome trend is for package managers to install files
;; in locations such as ~/.cabal/, ~/.rvm/, or ~/.emacs.d/elpa/.  It
;; is rarely meant for such files to be edited; doing so can cause
;; data loss in some circumstances.
;;
;; In addition, many user-writable files created in the course of
;; ordinary work should never be altered by a text editor, eg the
;; database stored in a .git directory.
;;
;; Hardhat.el provides an extra layer of protection in your work.  If
;; you visit a file which looks unsafe to edit, Emacs will make the
;; buffer read-only -- even when the underlying file is writable.
;;
;; The read-only protection can be turned off for a buffer by the
;; usual methods, or by toggling off buffer-local hardhat-mode via
;; the lighter menu or
;;
;;     M-x hardhat-mode RET
;;
;; If a buffer is not visiting a file, `hardhat-mode' has no effect.
;; If the visited file is not writable by the user, `hardhat-mode'
;; has no effect.
;;
;; To use hardhat, place the hardhat.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'hardhat)
;;     (global-hardhat-mode 1)
;;
;; To inquire as to why hardhat has set or unset protection in
;; a buffer, the following interactive command is provided
;;
;;     `hardhat-status'
;;
;; but not bound to any key.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET hardhat RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     `hardhat-mode' takes no action until the user attempts an
;;     interactive command in a buffer.  This is (out of an abundance
;;     of caution) for compatibility: an Emacs Lisp library may freely
;;     open and write to a file protected by `hardhat-mode', so long as
;;     it is done programatically.
;;
;;     For any of the options settable in customize, rules making
;;     buffers "editable" override rules making buffers "protected".
;;
;;     A Boolean file-local variable `hardhat-protect' is provided.
;;     When `hardhat-protect' is set to either t or nil, no other
;;     rules are consulted.
;;
;;     Regular-expression matches are case-insensitive.  A case-
;;     sensitive test can be implemented by adding custom function
;;     to eg `hardhat-buffer-protected-functions'.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.1 & 24.2    : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no
;;
;;     Uses if present: ignoramus.el
;;
;; Prior art
;;
;;     do-not-edit.el

;;     Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     This is alpha-quality software; bugs are expected.
;;
;;     More exceptions are certainly needed in `hardhat-fullpath-editable-regexps'
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     include more build-dirs for python and ruby
